#Final Project Proposal

For my final project, I plan on creating a visualisaton for different sotring algorithims. So far, I plan on creating deomonstrations for the following: 

1. Inserison sort
2. Bubble sort
3. Merge Sort
4. Quicksort
5. Bogosort (maybe)

To demonstrate theese algorithims, I am thinking of starting out with just ordering a list of boxes containing different words (like flashcards). From here, I will allow the user to 
select from one of the algorithims listed above, and my project will step by step shuffle the cards in order untill the list is sorted. Some features I plan on having include the following:

1. A menu/window that will allow the user to select ONE sorting algorithim to use at a time (radio buttons)
2. A menu/window that will allow the user to select what they want to sort (numbers or charecters)
3. Perhaps later on, graphics that actually look like Books (sorted alphabetically) or Glasses of some liquid sorted by volume, store items by price etc.

##Libraries to use

As for libraries, I plan on starting by using a simple graphics/ ui library 

Later on I may want to make my project a little more engaging by playing a little swapping sound for each step in the sorting process, for this I am considering the _______ library.

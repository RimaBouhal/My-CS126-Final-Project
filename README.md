This application can take in lists of words or phrases, and can demonstrate how each can be sorted alphabetically or 
by string length.

## Features: 

One thing I placed heavy emphasis on when it came to the making of this app was it's user interface. Af of right now, 
one can control my app three different ways. 

	1) Keyboard shortcuts

	This was the simplest of controls to implement, for it did not need to include any external libaries, API's or
	anything. This was the first User interface I created for the app, and while I meant to remove it in the end, I 
	decided to keep it for the sake of it's convenience.

	Below is a brief overview of their functionalities, please not that they are all independant of casing.

		0. 
		1.
		2.
		3. 
		4. 
		5. 

		H.
		V.

	2) Radio Buttons
	3) an OSC controller

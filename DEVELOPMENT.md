#DEVELOPMENT 

##Week 1: finding a project and testing libraries
1. Completed my Proposal.md

2. Explored libraries that I may be using.

3. Learned how to properly make an of project using the project generator.

4. Explored the example of projects where I found inspartation for my own.

##Week 2: continuing on
1. Proposal got approved (yay!)

2. Began to draw out my User Interface
     - Taking in word files (ie a list of movies)
	 - Using key shortcuts for different types of sorting
		- Numerically
		- Alphabetically
	 - Allow the user to sort using differtnt algorithims
		- Quicksort
		- Mergesort
	- Represent the movie lists as strings (written vertically)
	- Using different colors to differentiate between strings
	- Relative layout (the strings will spread out depending on the width of my screen)

3. Considered different libraries to use (those not mentioned in class)
	- JSON
		- Suggested by Michael from code review, to use for parsing the text files to sort
		- This would allow me to sort by episode (for a JSON of shows), year, title, etc.
	- SOUND
		- Suggested by Patrick (aka the best code mod)
		- Must add more to my idea for this to count as credit
			- Reading out the text
			- Making sounds of various pitches on each swap
				- dependant on the length/ heirarchy in the sort
				- super satisfying VooooOOOOOOooooP sound at the end
	- OFC CONTROLLER 
		- 

##Week 3: a hiccup / recovery period
 My computer broke down on Saturday, got a temporary replacement on Monday (morning). Luckily I saved my progress ahead of time, and did not loose much work...
